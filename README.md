## Why build this?

I was laid off on January 7th 2025.

I felt bad at first for a while,
then I realized it was an opportunity for me to build something for myself.

I finally got the time to build a personal website😻.

That's why I create this, I want a website that can contain my blogs and also can be presented as my resume.

Considering this as a gift to someone who may experienced the same and a guide or demo repo for Astro.

Besides that, I want it also support Google adsense, and maybe good affiliate supports.

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:
